# sql_challenge

For this challenge, CSVs were provided containing data for departments, employees, and other information for an organisation.
First, quickdatabasediagrams.com was used to sketch out an ERD based off the CSV tables. Then a database was created using PostGreSQL on pgAdmin. The query tool was created to create a table schema for each of the 6 CSVs, and each CSV file was imported directly into the corresponding SQL table.
Once a complete database was created, various queries were performed on the data.
